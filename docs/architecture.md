# System Architecture

## Overview
DevOps Simulator follows a microservices architecture designed for high availability and scalability. This document covers both production and development configurations.

### ⚙️ Experimental Extension
> **Note:** The Conflict-Simulator branch introduced experimental AI and multi-cloud architecture.
> These features are **under testing** and not part of the production environment yet.

## Components

### 1. Application Server
- **Technology**: Node.js + Express
- **Production Port**: 8080
- **Development Port**: 3000
- **Scaling**: Horizontal auto-scaling (production only)
- **Development Features**: Hot reload, debug mode

**Experimental Enhancements (not in production):**
- TensorFlow.js integration for AI inference
- Predictive auto-scaling based on ML models
- Apache Kafka event streaming

### 2. Database Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14
- **Production**: Master-slave replication with automated backups
- **Development**: Single local instance with seed data

**Experimental Setup:**
- PostgreSQL 5-node cluster with multi-master replication
- Redis cluster for cache optimization
- Geo-redundant continuous backup

### 3. Monitoring System
- **Production**: Prometheus + Grafana with email alerts
- **Development**: Console logging with verbose output
- **Metrics**: CPU, Memory, Disk, Network

**Experimental Monitoring:**
- Thanos for long-term storage
- ELK Stack with AI log analysis

## Deployment Strategy

### Production
- **Method**: Rolling updates
- **Zero-downtime**: Yes
- **Rollback**: Automated on failure
- **Region**: us-east-1

### Development
- **Method**: Docker Compose
- **Features**: Hot reload, instant feedback
- **Testing**: Automated tests before deployment

## Security
- **Production**: SSL/TLS encryption, strict access controls
- **Development**: Relaxed security for easier debugging
- **Experimental**: Zero-trust model with AES-256 encryption and audit logging
